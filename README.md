# Problem Statement

There are a plethora of issues when elementary school students cannot have in-person classes with their teachers. One of these issues include having an easy and convenient way to organize assignments in a single space. Depending on the class, teachers might feel conflicted on the current platform they are using to upload and receive assignment submissions. As a result, some of these teachers may use a variety of environments to accomodate for their different assignment types. Furthermore, young students have not built the planning skills needed to manage and organize their homework. With online classes becoming the norm, young students need a clear, easy-to use, and intuitive planner to keep track of all their assignments and daily 
tasks. 

# Interactive Prototype
